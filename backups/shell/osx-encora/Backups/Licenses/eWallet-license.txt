And then I saw that you had requested eWallet for macOS, instead.

You can use the following to install eWallet on your Mac:

eWallet 8.4 for mac OS

eWallet 8 for mac OS
  Name: Roberto Nogueira
  Key:    630548

If you are changing Macs, be sure to copy your current wallet data file (.WLT file) from the Documents folder (or wherever you store it) on your OLD Mac, to the Documents folder on your NEW Mac. Open the Documents folder on the NEW Mac, and double-click your wallet to open it in eWallet.
